#Â Vimwiki Memory Machine

## What it does
This simple plugin is meant to work with vimwiki to inform a user what wikis are most visited, and most developed.

## Requirements
* python3 support
* vimwiki

This plugin is inspired by the well known 1945 essay "As We May Think" published in The Atlantic written by Vannevar Bush: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/

Because I use vimwiki to store my notes, whether its for programming, learning german, or history, I have found that storing what I perceive as things I "learned" in my computer memory is often not a good representation of my human brain memory. This plugin is a dream project to make vimwiki display the wiki strength of certain topics to know which need more attention or reinforcement.
