### Inspiration

This plugin is inspired by the well known 1945 essay "As We May Think" published in The Atlantic written by Vannevar Bush: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/

Because I use vimwiki to save my notes, whether its to learn programming, german, or history, I have found that storing what I perceive as things I "learned" in my computer memory is often not a good representation of my human brain memory. This plugin is a dream project to make vimwiki add stats to somewhat visually represent my human memory and the likeliness in strength that I truly "know" or remember the contents in a wiki by being able to see what needs more attention or reinforcement.
